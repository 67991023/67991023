## About Me
I’m Sirana (Namo) — a 16-year-old computer engineering student. I love:
- Designing and experimenting with AI models (LLMs, speech/STT, ML pipelines)
- Cybersecurity research, with a special interest in reverse engineering and low-level analysis
- Building full-stack services that connect ML models to real-world apps

I learn fast, enjoy hands-on projects, and I’m always exploring new areas in AI and security.

## Skills & Tools
- Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, Bash
- ML / AI: Jupyter Notebooks, model prototyping, data processing
- Tools & Frameworks: PyTorch / TensorFlow (learning), NumPy, scikit-learn, REST APIs
- Cybersecurity: Reverse engineering fundamentals, static analysis, debugging
- Dev & infra: Git, Docker, basic backend development

## Featured Projects
Here are some of my public projects (links go to the repositories in my profile):

- [SamsungLearning](https://github.com/67991023/SamsungLearning) — baseModelforLLM (Jupyter Notebook). Early experiments with LLM foundations and training workflows.
- [MoodTrack](https://github.com/67991023/MoodTrack) — A JavaScript project for tracking moods and emotional states (front-end / app prototypes).
- [aegis_backend](https://github.com/67991023/aegis_backend) — Backend service for Aegis AI with RAG-aware emotional TTS functionality (Java-based backend).
- [recorderAI](https://github.com/67991023/recorderAI) — STT service created for a programming final project (Python).
- [recorderAIv_2](https://github.com/67991023/recorderAIv_2) — Continued improvements and iterations to recorderAI.

(If you want, I can add mini-demo GIFs or README badges for each project.)

## Current Focus & Goals
- Build and fine-tune compact, efficient AI models suitable for edge or low-resource deployment.
- Learn advanced reverse engineering techniques and practical vulnerability analysis.
- Connect ML backends and real-time services (TTS, STT) into robust, production-ready systems.
- Share knowledge through clean docs and reproducible notebooks.

---

## Learning Roadmap
- Short term: Model finetuning pipelines, better dataset curation, and transfer learning practice.
- Mid term: Deepen reverse engineering skills — static & dynamic analysis, IDA/Ghidra basics.
- Long term: Contribute to open-source security tools and build AI-driven security utilities.
